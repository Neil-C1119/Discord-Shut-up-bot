# Discord-Shut-up-bot
Playing around with the Discord.py API

This is a bot I've been working on for my personal Discord servers with a bunch of my friends. It's pretty simple, but I wanted to play around with the API and see what I can do with it.

It has commands to add, remove, call a specific or random quote, and it holds these quotes in a separate file. 

One of the main functions that gave me the idea of writing this bot is that our group has a running joke asking things like "who, when, etc." When someone responds you hit them back with a "Who asked?" or "When did I ask."

This joke got to the point where there would be conversations derailed and devolved into a war of people asking "who, where, how" and it got a little bit annoying. So when the bot detects that someone is trying to pull this joke it @mentions them and tells them to shut up.

The way it detects this is very simple but it has worked somewhat better than expected.
